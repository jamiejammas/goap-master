-is the world state like a black board? 
	-if so do we want to populate this world state via Barks? 

-if the world state isnt like a black board then we should have a bark in the dataprovider that is constantly 
telling everyone what is going on that will listen  

---------------------

back pack is our black board? 
	- because this 'holds' the current world state
	
if this is the case then how can 'bark' whats in our backpack? 
and how can receive these barks easily? 
	-we are a data provider so have an area to slot in barks? 
	
	
---------------

now that we know we have a blackboard, how should we go about 
broadcasting the worldstate?
